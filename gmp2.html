            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The goal of the GMP2 was to improve upon the original GLOW box prototype by incorporating additional features and functionality. To address mental health stigma as a social issue of concern, we propose to incorporate aspects of DIY, maker culture alongside educational workshops. The proposed workshops aim to guide participants in constructing their GLOW box while also learning about mental health concepts.</p>

            <div class="Ratto">
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uD4oJmX.jpg" alt="The five phases of critical making, inspiration (lightbulb emoji), understanding (book emoji), ideation (pencil emoji), making (saw emoji), sharing (speech bubble emoji)." class="center">
            </div>
            <p>The steps in the design process followed the five iterative phases of critical making. It begins with the first phase of Inspiration.</p>

<!--INSPIRATION-->
<div class="phase">
    <h3>1. Inspiration</h3>
            <p>In this stage, we used FigJam to brainstorm our ideas and sketch out some preliminary concepts. We followed up by doing some research on relevant literature to help further support our design plans and the effectiveness of the prototype.</p>
            <p>Topics like community engagement and mental health <sup>1</sup> the concept of self-stigma <sup>2, 3</sup>. In addition to topics previously explored, like productivity <sup>4, 5</sup> and wellness<sup> 6, 7</sup>.</p>
</div>
<!--UNDERSTANDING -->
<div class="phase">
    <h3>2. Understanding</h3>
    <h3>&emsp;Workshop Planning and Design</h3>
    <p>The design of these workshops would take a focus on participant’s education about mental health topics (illness, stigma, coping, etc.), led by a licensed mental health practitioner and supported by a member of the GLOW team. These workshops can vary in their depth and are presented through a tiered system, taking into account their willingness and interest in DIY projects and crafting. </p>
    <p> At Laurier, these workshops could be hosted in partnership with the Wellness Education Hub as a Thrive Week event or BF290 creditable workshop. For university students, the focus can be on promoting on-campus mental health resources and services in addition to the DIY making portion of the GLOW box. Students can be encouraged to attend as a destresser event and because of the opportunity to build their own GLOW box to take home. As students ourselves, we know that students like free stuff.</p>

<!--MATERIALS & TOOLS-->
        <div class="phase">
            <h3>&emsp;Materials and Tools</h3>
            <p>The construction phase began with gathering our materials and the necessary tools. We collected most items from recycling and around our apartments, but we did resort to purchasing some brand new materials or second-hand (if possible).</p>

<!--MAKING-->
        <div class="phase">
            <h3>4. Making</h3>
            <p>The making phase was split into a few distinct tasks: wooden base assembly, affixing the hinges, lightbulb wiring, plexiglass frame assembly, and finally the circuit wiring.</p>
            <p>First we worked on cutting out the plywood, staining it, and then gluing it together. The spots for the hinges were temporarily secured with tape, marked out in pencil and then superglued into place.  The lightbulb socket was fed through a hole in the top of the wooden base. 
                </p>

                </div>
            </div>  
            <p>Next came the assembly of the plexiglass frame, they were glued into pairs and slotted into the base. A hole was cut out of one of the panels to house the LCD screen. 
            </p>
            <p>The last step was wiring the circuit for the LCD and inserting all the electronics into the wooden base. This included the speaker for the white noise machine, the breadboard, power bank and the Arduino.</p>

<!--SHARING-->
<div class="phase">
    <h3>5. Sharing</h3>
    <p>During the “show and tell” presentation, our team shared some of the reflections on the prototype and a few ideas that we had. We’d like to explore the possibility of incorporating other capabilities of the Arduino microcontroller into the prototype. </p>
    <p>For example, the use of a single electronic component to control both the output of sound and visual display. </p>

<!--CHALLENGES -->

        <div class="challenges">
            <h3>Challenges Encountered</h3>
            <p>In the GLOW Box 2.0, our team struggled with incorporating the hinges. They were intended to attach to the lid and side panel, allowing access to the lightbulb and socket. However, the plexiglass could not bear the weight of the lid when in the open position and the panel bent a concerning amount.</p>
            <p>Thus, we had to support the lid when it was in the open position. Further reflection should have taken into account the thin and flexible nature of the plexiglass sheets that we were working with. In future iterations of the prototype, we could experiment by using different kinds of hinges and/or attaching them to have different points of contact.

                <h2 style="text-align: left;">What Worked and What Didn't</h2>
                <h3>What Did Work</h3>
                <p>In both projects, the brainstorming and sketching aspects set us up for success. The preliminary planning was thorough and allowed us to approach the prototype construction with an approach already in mind. Any improvisation or deviation from the sketches occurred because we needed to adapt to the characteristics of the materials. In constructing our first GLOW box, the majority of our prototype was built out of recycled materials, repurposed items or things we already owned.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3><br/>What Didn't Work</h3>
                <p>Time efficiency and the distribution of time dedicated to each of the phases of critical making was uneven and less than ideal. For both projects, it left the team with a short amount of time for the final stage of reconfiguration and conversation (in GMP1) and for the sharing stage (in GMP2). We could have benefited from a dedicated session to reflect and think critically about each prototype and the critical making process that accompanied it. It would have yielded more rich and engaging insights to share as part of our “show and tell” presentations.</p>
