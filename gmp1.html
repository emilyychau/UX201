            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Our group followed the critical making process to achieve the goal of GMP1, to “hack” the concept of a box. We reimagined it as a multipurpose and fully functional light fixture, designed to address the need for affordable yet customizable pieces of room decor. It would help to support different aspects of students’ lives–including their mood, mental health, and productivity habits.</p>

            <h3>Project Topics</h3>
            <p>To “hack” the concept of a traditional cardboard box, reimagining its size, shape and configuration. We took into consideration the accessibility of the prototype and its construction using sustainably sourced (i.e. recycled, repurposed, already owned) materials.</p>
            <h3>Aims & Objectives</h3>
            <p>The aim was to create a box that provides storage, has re-usable writing surfaces, and incorporates ambient lighting.</p>

            <p>I want to acknowledge the privilege I have to live and study on the territories traditionally occupied
                and cared for by Indigenous Peoples across Turtle Island. Laurier's campuses are located on the
                traditional territories of the Anishinabeg, Haudenosaunee and Attawandaron peoples. I am deeply grateful
                for the opportunity that I have to learn and grow on this land, which continues to be cared for by the
                First Peoples of Canada.</p>
