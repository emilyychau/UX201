        <div class="overview">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Our group followed the critical making process to achieve the goal of GMP1, to “hack” the concept of a box. We reimagined it as a multipurpose and fully functional light fixture, designed to address the need for affordable yet customizable pieces of room decor. It would help to support different aspects of students’ lives–including their mood, mental health, and productivity habits.</p>

            <p>The aim was to create a box that provides storage, has re-usable writing surfaces, and incorporates ambient lighting.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The steps in the design process followed the stages outlined in Ratto's critical making process. It begins with the first stage of “mining ideas”.</p>
            <h3>1. Mining for Ideas</h3>
            <p>In this stage, we used FigJam to brainstorm our ideas and sketch out some preliminary concepts. We followed up by doing some research on relevant literature to help further support our design plans and the effectiveness of the prototype.<br/>Topics like lighting and mood, <sup>1, 4, 5</sup>the effects of lighting on seasonal affective disorder <sup>2, 3</sup> and productivity<sup> 6</sup> were explored.</p>

        <h3>&emsp;Materials and Tools</h3>
        <p>The construction phase began with gathering our materials and the necessary tools. We collected most items from recycling and around our apartments, but we did resort to purchasing some brand new materials or second-hand (if possible).</p>

        <h3>3. Reconfiguration and Conversation</h3>
        <p>Amongst the team, this phase was quite brief since time was a major constraint. </p>

        <div class="challenges">
            <h3>Challenges Encountered</h3>
            <p>A notable struggle in the construction of the prototype was dealing with the magnetism and small size of the magnets. It was a difficult balance to evenly arrange them into clusters. Ultimately, it was a poor choice to connect the modular pieces together with magnetic attachments. They did not snap and connect together easily as anticipated. It ended up being more of an accessibility barrier to certain users, rather than the [assistive] feature we intended.</p>
            <p>To deal with the strong magnetism and the messiness of the super glue, the magnets were spaced far apart and atop a parchment paper workspace. Most importantly, the process was not rushed and an ample amount of time was allotted for glue to dry. Upon reflection for future iterations of the prototype, we could experiment with other methods of attaching the modules of this build. </p>

            <div class="column">
                <h3>What Worked and What Didn't<br/>What Didn't Work</h3>
                <p>In both projects, the brainstorming and sketching aspects set us up for success. The preliminary planning was thorough and allowed us to approach the prototype construction with an approach already in mind. Any improvisation or deviation from the sketches occurred because we needed to adapt to the characteristics of the materials. In constructing our first GLOW box, the majority of our prototype was built out of recycled materials, repurposed items or things we already owned.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <br/>
                <h3>What Didn't Work</h3>
                <p>Time efficiency and the distribution of time dedicated to each of the phases of critical making was uneven and less than ideal. For both projects, it left the team with a short amount of time for the final stage of reconfiguration and conversation (in GMP1) and for the sharing stage (in GMP2). We could have benefited from a dedicated session to reflect and think critically about each prototype and the critical making process that accompanied it. It would have yielded more rich and engaging insights to share as part of our “show and tell” presentations.</p>
